# Backend and infrastructure documentation

This directory documents the AWS CDK application, Go Lambda API, MySQL schema, Cognito identity model, and S3 image workflows implemented by this repository.

Start with the [architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) for the end-to-end request path. Use the topic guides below for implementation details.

## Implementation sources

The active CDK entrypoint, route registration, Lambda handlers, and current database initializer are authoritative:

- [`cdk-infrastructure.go`](../cdk-infrastructure.go) selects the stacks that synthesize.
- [`gateway/routes/`](../gateway/routes) defines the routes registered on the development and production HTTP APIs.
- [`lambda/api/`](../lambda/api) and [`lambda/internal/`](../lambda/internal) contain the active handlers and shared backend behavior.
- [`11_04_2025_create_core_tables_up.sql`](../lambda/internal/database/init/migrations/11_04_2025_create_core_tables_up.sql) defines the schema created by a fresh database initialization.

The repository also contains a commented-out stub stack, an unregistered database-test route helper, and earlier SQL snapshots. They are not part of the active API or fresh-install schema unless the CDK entrypoint or an active handler references them.
