# API migration map

This directory is the future boundary for the provider-independent backend API application. No handlers have been moved here yet. The current integrated implementation remains under [`infrastructure/legacy/`](../infrastructure/legacy/), and that code—not the historical planning document—is the source of truth for every status below.

The API remains the layer through which separately maintained frontend applications communicate with backend data:

```text
Frontend -> API -> Database
```

AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, and RDS are current adapters or hosting choices. They must not define the future application's core endpoint, authorization, storage, or database behavior.

## Legends

### Access

- 🟢 **Public** — the active API Gateway route has no Cognito authorizer.
- 🔴 **Authenticated / Protected** — the active route has the Cognito JWT authorizer, or an inactive historical route was explicitly designed to require authentication.
- 🔵 **Internal** — a Lambda or application function that is not exposed through API Gateway.

For inactive historical routes, the detailed **Authentication** field distinguishes historical intent from actual active configuration. The marker never implies that an absent route is deployed.

### Implementation and migration status

- ✅ **Implemented** — a corresponding active legacy route, handler, and required supporting behavior are identifiable for migration.
- 🟨 **Partial** — only a stub or supporting primitive exists, the route is inactive, or a deterministic wiring/query defect prevents the intended behavior.
- ⬜ **Not found** — no corresponding route/handler/query implementation was found.
- ❓ **Ambiguous** — evidence conflicts or a product decision is required before status can be resolved.

### Portability

“Portable” describes reusable application behavior, not whether the current Lambda can be copied unchanged. AWS coupling normally means an adapter must be extracted; it does not make the behavior unusable.

## Migration summary

This inventory contains **44 HTTP endpoint entries**:

| Status | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| ✅ Implemented | 15 |
| 🟨 Partial | 16 |
| ⬜ Not found | 13 |
| ❓ Ambiguous | 0 |

The 44 entries comprise:

- **18 active routes:** 15 ✅ and 3 🟨.
- **26 historical, replacement, or supporting candidates:** 13 🟨 and 13 ⬜.
- **1 internal non-HTTP function** documented separately; it is not included in the HTTP counts.

The three active partial routes are:

1. `POST /clubs/{clubId}/events`: wired, but its event and description INSERT statements are invalid.
2. `DELETE /clubs/{clubId}/members/me`: its handler requires JWT claims, but its active API Gateway route omits the authorizer.
3. `GET /clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/images`: its handler references a SQL file that does not exist.

The active development and production APIs register the same 18 method/path contracts. Three event-image `POST` paths additionally register `OPTIONS` against their Lambda integration; those preflight registrations are not counted as application endpoints. See the [detailed legacy route matrix](../infrastructure/legacy/docs/api/README.md#active-route-matrix).

## Evidence and interpretation rules

The inventory was checked against:

- active route registration in [`gateway/routes/`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/);
- both API stacks in [`productionApi.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/productionApi.go) and [`developmentApi.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/developmentApi.go);
- Lambda handlers under [`lambda/api/`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/);
- embedded SQL under [`utils/query_client/queries/`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/);
- authentication and authorization helpers under [`utils/auth/`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/auth/);
- image/S3 integrations and Cognito trigger wiring; and
- the inactive stub stack and stub handlers, which count only as partial evidence.

The historical `GWC Website Documentation.pdf`, preserved in the pre-refactor reference material, supplied the route grouping, intent, and green/red/blue visual model. Its checkmarks, assignments, dates, and project-management notes were not used as implementation evidence. Relevant historical sections are the original endpoint list (pages 14–18), “Endpoints Revamp” (pages 20–25), and image-upload flow (pages 33–35).

## Planned API directory structure

The following tree is **planned documentation only**. These directories do not exist yet and should be created incrementally as behavior is migrated and tested.

Route-shaped folders are navigation aids, not a reason to duplicate shared authorization, query, response, or storage logic. The corresponding **planned** query tree is documented in the [database migration map](../database/README.md#planned-database-directory-structure).

## Historical-to-current route changes

| Historical design | Current source-of-truth finding |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /me/clubs/events` | The active equivalent is `GET /me/events`; the old path survives only in the inactive stub stack. |
| `POST /clubs/{clubId}/members` | Self-join is active as `POST /clubs/{clubId}/members/me`; no endpoint can add a different student. |
| `POST /clubs/thumbnails` | The active path requires a club ID: `POST /clubs/{clubId}/thumbnails`. |
| `GET /clubs/verified=true` | Verification is a query parameter on `GET /clubs?verified=true`. |
| Separate event description and club subresources | The active `GET /events/{eventId}` response already joins description and associated-club IDs. The historical subresource routes are inactive stubs. |
| `/auth/events/{eventId}` revamp | No `/auth/events` route is active. Some image operations remain on older club-scoped paths and are currently public. |
| Generic `POST /images` | Event-gallery metadata is instead written by the active `POST .../images/confirm` route. No generic image route is active. |
| Club/event thumbnail confirmations | Presign handlers exist, but neither confirmation/metadata-assignment route exists. |
| Original club-scoped event detail/update/delete | The PDF later proposed `/auth/events`; neither protected form is active. Only club-scoped media paths remain. |

## Internal / student registration

### 🔵 ✅ Cognito student synchronization

**Purpose:** Upserts a student from Cognito `sub` and optional email after sign-up confirmation and after authentication.

**Invocation:** Cognito `PostConfirmation_ConfirmSignUp` and `PostAuthentication_Authentication`; not API Gateway.

**Legacy implementation:** [`lambda/internal/auth/postConfirm/upsert.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/internal/auth/postConfirm/upsert.go), wired by [`authorization.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/authorization.go) and the development API authorizer setup.

**Database query:** [Student existence and upsert](../database/README.md#1-student-existence-and-upsert) — [`students/UPSERT_student.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/students/UPSERT_student.sql).

**Target API location:** `api/internal/students/sync/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/students/ensure/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting Cognito event parsing and the AWS credential/connection adapter.

**Notes:** The handler logs and returns the original Cognito event when the database write fails, allowing authentication to continue. Protected HTTP handlers also call `RequireStudent` as a request-time fallback.

## Shared authentication and authorization dependencies

| Capability | Legacy source | Current use | Planned responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extract verified `sub` and optional email | [`extract_sub.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/auth/extract_sub.go) | Club/event creation and membership handlers | HTTP/identity adapter plus application identity context |
| Ensure a student row exists | [`ensure_student.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/auth/ensure_student.go) | All six JWT-attached handlers | Shared student synchronization service |
| Check club e-board/owner role | [`club_authorization.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/auth/club_authorization.go) and duplicate [`lambda/internal` helper](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/internal/auth/club_authorization/club_authorization.go) | **No active handler calls it** | Shared club authorization policy using [query group 13](../database/README.md#13-club-authorization) |
| Check event-associated club role | [`event_authorization.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/auth/event_authorization.go) and duplicate [`lambda/internal` helper](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/internal/auth/event_authorization/event_authorization.go) | **No active handler calls it** | Shared event authorization policy using [query group 14](../database/README.md#14-event-authorization) |
| Format validation errors | [`validation_error.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/errors/validation_error.go) | Club and event create handlers | Shared transport-neutral validation result mapping |

A Cognito JWT establishes identity only. It does not establish admin, membership, e-board, owner, or event authority. The current enforcement gaps must be preserved as known migration work, not silently presented as implemented authorization.

## Me

### 🔴 ✅ GET `/me`

**Purpose:** Returns the student record associated with the caller's verified Cognito `sub`.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached; identity-scoped only.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/student_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/student_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/me/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/me/get.go).

**Database query:** [Current student](../database/README.md#2-current-student) — [`students/SELECT_student_by_sub.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/students/SELECT_student_by_sub.sql), plus the shared student-existence/upsert group.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`. No role check is required because the lookup is caller-relative.

**Target API location:** `api/me/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/me/get/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting API Gateway/JWT parsing and database connection creation.

**Notes:** The database permits a null email while the current Go response model uses a non-nullable string; preserve the current contract intentionally or correct it in a separately reviewed migration.

### 🔴 ✅ GET `/me/clubs`

**Purpose:** Lists clubs joined by the caller and computes `owner`, `eboard`, or `member` for each membership.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/student_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/student_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/me/clubs/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/me/clubs/get.go).

**Database query:** [Current student's clubs and roles](../database/README.md#3-current-students-clubs-and-roles) — [`students/SELECT_student_clubs.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/students/SELECT_student_clubs.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`; membership rows scope the result.

**Target API location:** `api/me/clubs/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/me/clubs/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting HTTP/JWT and database adapters.

**Notes:** The field named `thumbnailUrl` currently contains the database `object_key`, not a signed or public URL.

### 🔴 ✅ GET `/me/events`

**Purpose:** Lists posted events associated with clubs the caller has joined, with date and pagination filters.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/student_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/student_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/me/events/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/me/events/get.go).

**Database query:** [Current student's events](../database/README.md#4-current-students-events) — [`students/SELECT_student_events.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/students/SELECT_student_events.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`; `club_members` scopes results.

**Target API location:** `api/me/events/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/me/events/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting HTTP/JWT and database adapters.

**Notes:** This is the active replacement for historical `GET /me/clubs/events`. SQL paginates joined rows before Go groups them by event, so one page can contain fewer distinct events and partial club associations.

### 🔴 🟨 GET `/me/clubs/events`

**Purpose:** Historical path for the caller's club events.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Defined only by the commented-out [`StubLambdaStack`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/stubLambda.go) with a hard-coded handler at [`stub/lambda/me/clubs/events/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/me/clubs/events/get.go). The real implementation moved to `GET /me/events`.

**Database query:** [Current student's events](../database/README.md#4-current-students-events) is the active implementation. A stale hard-coded SQL example remains at [`GET_me_clubs_events.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/me/clubs/events/GET_me_clubs_events.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Same caller identity and membership scoping as `GET /me/events`.

**Target API location:** Reuse `api/me/events/get/` (**planned**); retain the old path only if an explicit compatibility requirement is approved.

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/me/events/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the real replacement is portable, but the historical route itself is not active.

**Notes:** Do not migrate both paths as separate business logic.

### 🔴 🟨 GET `/me/clubs/eboard`

**Purpose:** Lists clubs for which the caller is an e-board member or owner.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Inactive stub route in [`stubLambda.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/stubLambda.go) and hard-coded handler [`stub/lambda/me/clubs/eboard/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/me/clubs/eboard/get.go).

**Database query:** [My e-board clubs](../database/README.md#17-my-e-board-clubs) — stale stub SQL at [`eboard.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/me/clubs/eboard/eboard.sql); the active club/role query can likely be reused.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; membership with `member_is_eboard` or `member_is_owner`.

**Target API location:** `api/me/clubs/eboard/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/me/clubs/eboard/list/`, or reuse `database/queries/me/clubs/list/` with an explicit role filter (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial.

**Notes:** The stub SQL has an `AND`/`OR` precedence defect and selects student IDs rather than clubs; it is design evidence, not migration-ready SQL.

## Clubs

### 🟢 ✅ GET `/clubs`

**Purpose:** Lists club summaries. With `verified=true` or `verified=TRUE`, returns only clubs represented in `verified_clubs`; otherwise returns all clubs.

**Authentication:** None.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/get.go).

**Database query:** [Club list and verified filter](../database/README.md#5-club-list-and-verified-filter) — [`clubs/SELECT_clubs.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/SELECT_clubs.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** None; verification is a data filter, not an authorization grant.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/list/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the HTTP and database adapters.

**Notes:** This one active route covers both historical “all clubs” and `GET /clubs?verified=true` behavior.

### 🔴 ✅ POST `/clubs`

**Purpose:** Creates a club and its `club_info` row.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached. No admin check is performed.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/post/post.go).

**Database query:** [Club creation](../database/README.md#7-club-creation) — [`clubs/INSERT_club.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/INSERT_club.sql) and [`clubs/INSERT_club_info.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/INSERT_club_info.sql) in `ExecInsertQuery`.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`. No admin, membership, or ownership helper is called.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/create/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/create/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting HTTP/JWT and database adapters.

**Notes:** The creator is not inserted into `club_members`, no owner is assigned, and the club is not verified. Whether creator ownership should be added is the database map's [manual-review item](../database/README.md#29-club-creator-ownership).

### 🟢 ✅ GET `/clubs/{clubId}`

**Purpose:** Returns one club with its name, logo object key, website URL, and description.

**Authentication:** None.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/clubId/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/clubId/get.go).

**Database query:** [Club detail](../database/README.md#6-club-detail) — [`clubs/SELECT_club.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/SELECT_club.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** None.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/get/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the HTTP and database adapters.

**Notes:** The handler passes `clubId` to SQL without integer validation and reports a missing row through its `400` helper rather than `404`.

### 🔴 ⬜ GET `/clubs/{clubId}/members`

**Purpose:** Historical protected listing of a club's members.

**Authentication:** Historically limited to e-board members and owners; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, or application query found; only placeholder text exists under [`stub/lambda/clubs/clubId/members/`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/clubs/clubId/members/).

**Database query:** [Club member and e-board listing](../database/README.md#18-club-member-and-e-board-listing) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Club e-board/owner check using the reusable club authorization policy.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/members/list/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/members/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Decide response fields, pagination, and whether ordinary members may see any subset before implementation.

### 🔴 ⬜ GET `/clubs/{clubId}/eboard`

**Purpose:** Historical protected listing of owner/e-board memberships for a club.

**Authentication:** Historically limited to e-board members and owners; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, or query found; only placeholder material exists.

**Database query:** Reuse [club member and e-board listing](../database/README.md#18-club-member-and-e-board-listing) with an explicit role filter.

**Authorization dependencies:** Club e-board/owner check.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/members/list/` with a role filter, or `api/clubs/{clubId}/eboard/get/` if a distinct contract is retained (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** Prefer shared `database/queries/clubs/members/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Avoid duplicate member-list SQL solely to preserve two route names.

### 🔴 ✅ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/members/me`

**Purpose:** Joins the authenticated caller to a club as a regular member.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/clubId/members/me/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/clubId/members/me/post/post.go).

**Database query:** [Join caller to club](../database/README.md#8-join-caller-to-club) — [`clubs/INSERT_club_member.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/INSERT_club_member.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`. The caller identity, not a body-supplied student ID, is inserted.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/members/join/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/members/create/` or a caller-specific wrapper under `join/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting HTTP/JWT and database adapters.

**Notes:** This is the active self-service form of historical `POST /clubs/{clubId}/members`. It assigns both role flags false and does not require the club to be verified.

### 🔴 ⬜ PUT `/clubs/{clubId}/members/roles`

**Purpose:** Historical owner-only promotion or demotion of a member's e-board/owner flags.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, or `UPDATE club_members` query found.

**Database query:** [Update member roles](../database/README.md#20-update-member-roles) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus owner-only policy. The existing club helper allows e-board **or** owner and is therefore not sufficient for the historical owner-only rule without refinement.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/members/roles/update/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/members/update_role/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** The historical query parameters did not identify the member consistently; define the target-member contract before migration.

### 🟢 🟨 DELETE `/clubs/{clubId}/members/me`

**Purpose:** Leaves a club as the current student while preventing an owner membership from being deleted.

**Authentication:** **Misconfigured in legacy.** The active API Gateway route is public, but the handler requires verified JWT claims and therefore returns before executing the delete in ordinary calls.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go) — the registration omits `Authorizer`.

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/clubId/members/me/delete/delete.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/clubId/members/me/delete/delete.go).

**Database query:** [Leave caller's club](../database/README.md#9-leave-callers-club) — [`clubs/DELETE_club_member.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/DELETE_club_member.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Intended verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`; SQL owner guard.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/members/leave/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/members/leave/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the handler/query logic is reusable after correcting the transport authorization boundary.

**Notes:** This documentation records the defect; this task does not change route behavior. A nullable owner flag also requires review because `member_is_owner = FALSE` does not match null.

### 🟢 ✅ GET `/clubs/{clubId}/events`

**Purpose:** Lists posted events linked to a club with date and pagination filters.

**Authentication:** None.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/clubId/events/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/clubId/events/get.go).

**Database query:** [Club event list](../database/README.md#10-club-event-list) — [`clubs/SELECT_club_events.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/clubs/SELECT_club_events.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** None; the handler hardcodes `posted` status.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/events/list/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/events/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the HTTP and database adapters.

**Notes:** Joined-row pagination, strict date comparisons, map-based response grouping, placeholder thumbnails, and partial association results are current behaviors requiring contract tests before migration.

### 🔴 ⬜ GET `/clubs/{clubId}/events/drafts`

**Purpose:** Historical e-board/owner listing of drafted events for one club.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No active route or handler. The current club-event SQL is status-parameterized, but its handler always supplies `posted`.

**Database query:** [Club draft events](../database/README.md#21-club-draft-events) — reusable query support exists, endpoint behavior does not.

**Authorization dependencies:** Club e-board/owner check.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/events/drafts/get/` (**planned**) or an authenticated filter on the shared list service.

**Target database query location:** Reuse `database/queries/clubs/events/list/` with an explicit authorized status policy (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A as an endpoint; the underlying read query is portable.

**Notes:** Do not expose a caller-controlled status filter without enforcing the role policy first.

### 🔴 🟨 POST `/clubs/{clubId}/events`

**Purpose:** Creates a drafted event, owner-club link, associate-club links, and description.

**Authentication:** Cognito JWT authorizer attached. Contrary to the historical design, no membership/e-board/owner authorization check runs.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/clubId/events/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/clubId/events/post/post.go).

**Database query:** [Create event draft](../database/README.md#12-create-event-draft) — [`INSERT_event.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/events/INSERT_event.sql), [`INSERT_event_club_link.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/events/INSERT_event_club_link.sql), and [`INSERT_event_description.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/events/INSERT_event_description.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; `RequireStudent`; should call the club authorization policy but currently does not.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/events/create/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/create/` (**planned**, shared across route adapters).

**Portable:** Partial; validation and orchestration are reusable after SQL repair, one transaction boundary, and authorization extraction.

**Notes:** `INSERT_event.sql` lists 11 columns but only 10 values and omits an RSVP value expression; `INSERT_event_description.sql` has a trailing comma. The initial event insert is also outside the later link/description transaction.

### 🟢 ✅ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/thumbnails`

**Purpose:** Returns a one-minute S3 presigned PUT URL for a club-thumbnail object key.

**Authentication:** None in the active route.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/club_image_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/club_image_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/thumbnails/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/thumbnails/post/post.go).

**Database query:** N/A. The endpoint only signs storage access; [thumbnail metadata assignment](../database/README.md#27-club-and-event-thumbnail-metadata-assignment) is not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** None currently; historical intent was protected and should be resolved before migration.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/thumbnails/presign/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** N/A for presigning; confirmation would use `database/queries/clubs/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after introducing a storage-provider abstraction.

**Notes:** The handler does not verify club existence or caller authority and does not create image metadata or update `clubs.fk_logo_id`.

## Events

### 🟢 ✅ GET `/events`

**Purpose:** Lists posted events with optional date and pagination filters.

**Authentication:** None.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/events/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/events/get.go).

**Database query:** [Public/composite event read](../database/README.md#11-public-and-composite-event-read) — [`events/SELECT_events.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/events/SELECT_events.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** None; the handler hardcodes `posted` status.

**Target API location:** `api/events/list/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/read/` with a list wrapper (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the HTTP and database adapters.

**Notes:** Preserve or deliberately revise strict date bounds, joined-row pagination, unordered map grouping, and the fixed placeholder thumbnail through contract tests.

### 🟢 ✅ GET `/events/{eventId}`

**Purpose:** Returns one posted event with its description, owner-club ID, and associate-club IDs.

**Authentication:** None.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/events/eventId/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/events/eventId/get.go).

**Database query:** Reuses [public/composite event read](../database/README.md#11-public-and-composite-event-read) and [`events/SELECT_events.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/events/SELECT_events.sql) with `status='posted'` and the ID as a `LIKE` argument.

**Authorization dependencies:** None; drafted and archived events are excluded by the hardcoded status.

**Target API location:** `api/events/{eventId}/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** Reuse `database/queries/events/read/` with a single-event wrapper (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the HTTP and database adapters.

**Notes:** This composite response supersedes historical dedicated description and club subresources. The handler requires only a non-empty ID and caps joined rows at 100.

### 🟢 🟨 GET `/events/{eventId}/images`

**Purpose:** Historical public gallery read for a posted event.

**Authentication:** Historically public; no active exact-path route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Inactive stub route in [`stubLambda.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/internal/stack/stubLambda.go) with hard-coded handler [`stub/lambda/events/eventId/images/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/events/eventId/images/get.go). A changed club-scoped route is active but cannot load its missing query.

**Database query:** [Event-image list](../database/README.md#16-event-image-list) — required `images`/`event_images` join is missing.

**Authorization dependencies:** Public reads must first establish that the event is posted; the current club-scoped handler does not perform that check.

**Target API location:** `api/events/{eventId}/images/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/images/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; requires a query, a posted-visibility policy, and a storage-provider abstraction.

**Notes:** Do not treat the hard-coded stub response as an implementation contract.

### 🟢 🟨 GET `/events/{eventId}/description`

**Purpose:** Historical public description subresource for a posted event.

**Authentication:** Historically public; no active dedicated route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Inactive stub handler [`stub/lambda/events/eventId/description/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/events/eventId/description/get.go). The real active `GET /events/{eventId}` already returns the description.

**Database query:** Reuse [public/composite event read](../database/README.md#11-public-and-composite-event-read); a stale stub query remains at [`description.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/events/eventId/description/description.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** Posted-event visibility.

**Target API location:** No separate endpoint is planned; use `api/events/{eventId}/get/` unless compatibility requires a subresource adapter.

**Target database query location:** Reuse `database/queries/events/read/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial as a historical route; the combined behavior is portable.

**Notes:** Avoid duplicating the event read solely to recreate the old path.

### 🟢 🟨 GET `/events/{eventId}/clubs`

**Purpose:** Historical public listing of the owner and associated clubs for a posted event.

**Authentication:** Historically public; no active dedicated route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Inactive hard-coded handler [`stub/lambda/events/eventId/clubs/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/events/eventId/clubs/get.go). The active event-detail response already groups owner and associate club IDs.

**Database query:** Reuse [public/composite event read](../database/README.md#11-public-and-composite-event-read).

**Authorization dependencies:** Posted-event visibility.

**Target API location:** No separate endpoint is planned; use `api/events/{eventId}/get/` unless compatibility requires a subresource adapter.

**Target database query location:** Reuse `database/queries/events/read/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial as a historical route; the combined behavior is portable.

**Notes:** Current composite responses include club IDs but leave club names empty and substitute a fixed thumbnail URL.

## Authorized events

The historical revamp introduced `/auth/events` because an event may be associated with several clubs; authorization should not depend on one `{clubId}` in the route. No route in this section is active today.

### 🔴 🟨 GET `/auth/events/{eventId}`

**Purpose:** Returns a draft, posted, or otherwise non-public event to an authorized club manager.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No composed handler. The active public [`eventId/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/events/eventId/get.go) and unused event-authorization helper are separate reusable primitives.

**Database query:** [Authorized event read](../database/README.md#24-authorized-event-read) can reuse [event read](../database/README.md#11-public-and-composite-event-read) plus [event authorization](../database/README.md#14-event-authorization).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; e-board/owner of any club linked to the event.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** Reuse `database/queries/events/read/` and `database/queries/authorization/events/can_manage/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the read and policy primitives exist but are not composed.

**Notes:** Define which statuses an authorized caller may see and whether authors have any independent permission.

### 🔴 🟨 GET `/auth/events/{eventId}/images`

**Purpose:** Returns image metadata/URLs for an event, including non-public events, after event-role authorization.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** A public club-scoped handler exists at [`lambda/api/clubs/events/images/get/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/images/get/get.go), but it references missing SQL and performs no role check.

**Database query:** [Event-image list](../database/README.md#16-event-image-list) plus [event authorization](../database/README.md#14-event-authorization).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; e-board/owner of a linked club.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/images/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/images/list/` plus shared authorization query (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; requires missing SQL, policy composition, and a storage adapter.

**Notes:** The current handler ignores `{clubId}` and should not be duplicated merely to support this route.

### 🔴 ⬜ PATCH `/auth/events/{eventId}`

**Purpose:** Updates event fields and supports state changes such as draft-to-posted publication.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, update query, or transaction orchestration found.

**Database query:** [Event update and publish](../database/README.md#25-event-update-and-publish) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; event e-board/owner policy; field-level validation and an explicit status-transition policy.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/update/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/update/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Define patch semantics, allowed fields, optimistic concurrency, associate-club changes, and publication rules before writing SQL.

### 🔴 🟨 POST `/auth/events/{eventId}/thumbnails`

**Purpose:** Returns an upload URL for an event thumbnail after event-role authorization.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active `/auth` route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Core S3 signing exists at the public club-scoped handler [`lambda/api/clubs/events/thumbnails/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/thumbnails/post/post.go).

**Database query:** N/A for presigning. [Thumbnail metadata assignment](../database/README.md#27-club-and-event-thumbnail-metadata-assignment) is absent.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; event e-board/owner policy.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/thumbnails/presign/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** N/A for signing; confirmation would use `database/queries/events/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the signer is reusable behind a storage-provider abstraction, but authorization and confirmation are missing.

**Notes:** Decide whether the future canonical route remains club-scoped or moves to `/auth`; do not maintain two independent signers.

### 🔴 🟨 POST `/auth/events/{eventId}/images`

**Purpose:** Returns an upload URL for an event-gallery image after event-role authorization.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active `/auth` route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Core S3 signing exists at the public club-scoped handler [`lambda/api/clubs/events/images/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/images/post/post.go), with a separate public confirmation handler.

**Database query:** N/A for presigning; [event-image metadata confirmation](../database/README.md#15-event-image-metadata-confirmation) applies after upload.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; event e-board/owner policy.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/images/presign/` and `confirm/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/images/confirm/` for confirmation (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the signer/confirmation behavior is reusable after policy, storage, and transaction extraction.

**Notes:** The current endpoints trust client-provided metadata and do not verify the S3 object before database insertion.

### 🔴 ⬜ DELETE `/auth/events/{eventId}`

**Purpose:** Archives or deletes an event according to the product retention policy.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, archive/delete query, or cleanup workflow found.

**Database query:** [Event deletion](../database/README.md#26-event-deletion) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub`; event e-board/owner policy.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/delete/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/delete/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** The schema supports both `status='archived'` and `deleted_at`, while current public reads do not filter `deleted_at`; choose one lifecycle policy before implementation.

## Admins

The historical design required every admin route to verify the caller is already an admin. The schema contains an `admins` table, but the active application has no admin route or admin-check helper.

### 🔴 ⬜ GET `/admins`

**Purpose:** Lists administrator records and any approved related information.

**Authentication:** Historically protected with an admin check; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No executable route, handler, or list query found.

**Database query:** [Admin CRUD](../database/README.md#22-admin-crud) — list behavior is required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified `sub` plus reusable admin-status check, which is also missing.

**Target API location:** `api/admins/list/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/admins/list/` and a shared `is_admin` query (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Define whether “their id and clubs” means managed clubs, ordinary memberships, or a separate response before implementation.

### 🔴 🟨 GET `/admins/{studentId}`

**Purpose:** Returns one administrator record if present.

**Authentication:** Historically protected with an admin check; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Only an unwired SQL stub at [`GET_admins_studentId.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/admins/studentId/GET_admins_studentId.sql); it hardcodes student ID `2` and has no handler.

**Database query:** [Admin CRUD](../database/README.md#22-admin-crud).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus admin-status check.

**Target API location:** `api/admins/{studentId}/get/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/admins/get/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the schema intent is clear, but the stub is not parameterized migration-ready code.

**Notes:** Current student IDs are Cognito UUID strings, not the integer used by the stale stub.

### 🔴 ⬜ POST `/admins`

**Purpose:** Promotes a student by inserting an admin record.

**Authentication:** Historically protected with an admin check; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, insert query, or admin authorization helper found.

**Database query:** [Admin CRUD](../database/README.md#22-admin-crud) — create behavior is required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus admin-status check; target student existence validation.

**Target API location:** `api/admins/create/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/admins/create/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Define bootstrap/last-admin policy so administration cannot be granted or removed without a recoverable authority path.

### 🔴 🟨 DELETE `/admins/{studentId}`

**Purpose:** Demotes a student by deleting the admin record.

**Authentication:** Historically protected with an admin check; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Only an unwired SQL stub at [`DELETE_admins_studentId.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/stub/lambda/admins/studentId/DELETE_admins_studentId.sql); it hardcodes student ID `2` and has no handler.

**Database query:** [Admin CRUD](../database/README.md#22-admin-crud).

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus admin-status check.

**Target API location:** `api/admins/{studentId}/delete/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/admins/delete/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; only obsolete SQL-shaped evidence exists.

**Notes:** A last-admin/self-demotion policy requires manual product review.

## Verification / club administration

Public verification reads are already implemented by [`GET /clubs?verified=true`](#-get-clubs). The historical write routes below are not.

### 🔴 ⬜ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/verification`

**Purpose:** Marks a club verified by inserting it into `verified_clubs`.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** Schema support and read filtering exist, but no route, handler, insert query, or admin check was found.

**Database query:** [Club verification writes](../database/README.md#23-club-verification-writes) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus an approved club-administration policy, historically admin-only.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/verification/create/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/verification/create/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** The unique table row makes the write naturally idempotent only if duplicate handling is defined.

### 🔴 ⬜ DELETE `/clubs/{clubId}/verification`

**Purpose:** Removes a club from the verified set.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, delete query, or admin check found.

**Database query:** [Club verification writes](../database/README.md#23-club-verification-writes) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus club-administration policy.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/verification/delete/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/verification/delete/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Unverification currently affects discovery filtering only; it is not a membership or authorization revocation.

## Images

The current image flow signs short-lived S3 URLs so clients transfer bytes directly to S3. Storage signing is application behavior that can be retained behind an adapter; S3 itself should not define the API. See the [legacy image-flow documentation](../infrastructure/legacy/docs/architecture/image-uploads.md).

### 🟢 🟨 GET `/clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/images`

**Purpose:** Loads event-image metadata and returns one-minute signed GET URLs.

**Authentication:** None in the active route.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/events/images/get/get.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/images/get/get.go).

**Database query:** [Event-image list](../database/README.md#16-event-image-list). The referenced `images/SELECT_event_images.sql` file is absent.

**Authorization dependencies:** None currently. The handler neither checks posted visibility nor a club/event role.

**Target API location:** Prefer public `api/events/{eventId}/images/get/` for posted events and authenticated `api/auth/events/{eventId}/images/get/` for drafts (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** Shared `database/queries/events/images/list/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the response/signing behavior is reusable after adding SQL, visibility policy, and a storage-provider abstraction.

**Notes:** The active handler ignores `{clubId}` and deterministically returns its query-error response before reaching S3 signing.

### 🟢 ✅ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/images`

**Purpose:** Creates a UUID-based object key and a one-minute signed PUT URL for an event-gallery image.

**Authentication:** None in the active route.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/events/images/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/images/post/post.go).

**Database query:** N/A; metadata is written only by the separate confirmation endpoint.

**Authorization dependencies:** None currently; the handler does not verify club/event existence, association, or caller role.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/images/presign/` or a retained club-scoped adapter (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** N/A for presigning.

**Portable:** Yes, after introducing a storage-provider abstraction and authorization policy.

**Notes:** The handler ignores `{clubId}`, accepts any non-empty filename/MIME type, and signs `events/{eventId}/images/{uuid}{extension}`.

### 🟢 ✅ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/images/confirm`

**Purpose:** Records uploaded image metadata and links the image to an event.

**Authentication:** None in the active route.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/events/images/confirm/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/images/confirm/post.go).

**Database query:** [Event-image metadata confirmation](../database/README.md#15-event-image-metadata-confirmation) — [`images/INSERT_image.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/images/INSERT_image.sql) then [`images/INSERT_event_image.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/images/INSERT_event_image.sql).

**Authorization dependencies:** None currently.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/images/confirm/` or a retained club-scoped adapter (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/images/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after extracting the database/storage adapters and making confirmation transactional.

**Notes:** The handler ignores `{clubId}`, trusts client-supplied IDs/keys/MIME metadata, does not check S3 object existence, and commits its two inserts independently.

### 🟢 ✅ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/thumbnails`

**Purpose:** Returns a one-minute signed PUT URL for an event thumbnail.

**Authentication:** None in the active route.

**Legacy route:** [`gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/gateway/routes/event_image_routes.go).

**Legacy handler:** [`lambda/api/clubs/events/thumbnails/post/post.go`](../infrastructure/legacy/lambda/api/clubs/events/thumbnails/post/post.go).

**Database query:** N/A. No metadata confirmation or `events.fk_thumbnail_id` assignment exists; see [thumbnail metadata assignment](../database/README.md#27-club-and-event-thumbnail-metadata-assignment).

**Authorization dependencies:** None currently.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/thumbnails/presign/` or a retained club-scoped adapter (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** N/A for presigning; confirmation would use `database/queries/events/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** Yes, after introducing storage and authorization adapters.

**Notes:** The handler ignores `{clubId}` and signs `events/{eventId}/thumbnails/{uuid}{extension}`.

### 🔴 ⬜ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/thumbnails/confirm`

**Purpose:** Historical image-flow step to persist club-thumbnail metadata and assign the uploaded image to the club.

**Authentication:** No active route; future write should require an approved club role.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, query transaction, or S3 verification found.

**Database query:** [Thumbnail metadata assignment](../database/README.md#27-club-and-event-thumbnail-metadata-assignment) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus club e-board/owner policy.

**Target API location:** `api/clubs/{clubId}/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/clubs/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Confirmation should create/reuse image metadata, update `clubs.fk_logo_id`, and define replacement cleanup atomically where possible.

### 🔴 ⬜ POST `/clubs/{clubId}/events/{eventId}/thumbnails/confirm`

**Purpose:** Historical image-flow step to persist event-thumbnail metadata and assign it to the event.

**Authentication:** No active route; future write should require event authority.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, query transaction, or S3 verification found.

**Database query:** [Thumbnail metadata assignment](../database/README.md#27-club-and-event-thumbnail-metadata-assignment) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus event e-board/owner policy.

**Target API location:** `api/auth/events/{eventId}/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/events/thumbnails/confirm/` (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** The current presign response provides the required identifiers, but no code consumes them to update `events.fk_thumbnail_id`.

### 🔵 🟨 Internal image metadata write (historical `POST /images`)

**Purpose:** The historical revamp described an internal post-upload function that inserts generic image metadata.

**Invocation:** Historically blue/internal, not an active API Gateway route.

**Legacy implementation:** No generic handler. Equivalent metadata insertion exists only inside the active event-image confirmation handler.

**Database query:** Reuse [`images/INSERT_image.sql`](../infrastructure/legacy/utils/query_client/queries/images/INSERT_image.sql) from [event-image metadata confirmation](../database/README.md#15-event-image-metadata-confirmation).

**Authorization dependencies:** Depends on the calling workflow; the current event confirmation has none.

**Target API location:** Prefer a shared internal image-metadata service under `api/internal/images/confirm/`, called by route-specific confirmation handlers (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** Shared image insert within the route-appropriate confirmation transaction (**planned**).

**Portable:** Partial; the insert primitive exists, but the generic function/contract does not.

**Notes:** Do not expose a generic public write merely because the historical label resembles an HTTP path.

### 🔴 ⬜ DELETE `/images/{imageId}`

**Purpose:** Deletes image metadata and, under an explicit lifecycle policy, the corresponding stored object.

**Authentication:** Historically protected; no active route exists.

**Legacy implementation:** No route, handler, SQL cleanup, or S3 delete workflow found.

**Database query:** [Image deletion](../database/README.md#28-image-deletion) — required but not implemented.

**Authorization dependencies:** Verified caller plus ownership/club/event/admin policy based on the image's purpose and links.

**Target API location:** `api/images/{imageId}/delete/` (**planned**).

**Target database query location:** `database/queries/images/delete/` plus a storage deletion adapter (**planned**).

**Portable:** N/A until implemented.

**Notes:** Define link cleanup, thumbnail foreign-key clearing, object deletion ordering, failure recovery, and orphan retention before implementation.
